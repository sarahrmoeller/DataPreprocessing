# DataPreprocessing
Code and data for preprocessing IGTs for machine learning experiments. Data is is flextext XML exported for Fieldworks Language Explorer. The csv files follow [CLDF](https://github.com/cldf/cldf).

Note that flextext data can be extracted with this code: https://github.com/sarahrmoeller/extractflextext However, this extracted code has been changed and as of 6/2024 does not output canonicla morphemes and is unlikely to be compatible with the code that converts to CLDF (csv format).
